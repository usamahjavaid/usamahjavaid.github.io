## Welcome to Usamahs GitHub Page

Hello, welcome to my progress in github page development

### About me
My name is Usamah and i am 24 years old. I finished my Academy Profession (AP) Degree in Financial Controlling, and I tried working as an accountant for 1 year. I quickly found out that the profession wasn't for me. My twin brother introduced me to computer science, and i found it interesting. And now i am learning programming. I do suck at programming, but i am learning quickly thanks to my classmates and teachers.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/usamahjavaid/usamahjavaid.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
