## Welcome to Usamahs GitHub Page

Hello, welcome to my progress in github page development

### About me
My name is Usamah J.Iqbal and i am 24 years old. I finished my Academy Profession (AP) Degree in Financial Controlling, and I tried working as an accountant for 1 year. I quickly found out that the profession wasn't for me. My twin brother introduced me to computer science, and I found it interesting. And now I am learning programming. I do suck at programming, but I am learning quickly thanks to my classmates and teachers. 

```markdown
// My first program

public class DisplayThreeNames1 {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println(" Welcome to Java ");
System.out.println(" Learning java now ");
System.out.println(" Programming is fun ");
    }
